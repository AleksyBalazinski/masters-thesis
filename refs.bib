Tree algorithms should be suitable for studying a wide range of astrophysical phenomena, including potentially both collisional and collisionless systems. As an example, a simulation of the decay of a satellite orbit around a self-gravitating disk with N = 32,768, performed with the tree method, is compared with previous calculations.}

    abstract = {In N-body simulations the force calculated between particles representing a given mass distribution is usually softened, to diminish the effect of graininess. In this paper we study the effect of such a smoothing, with the aim of finding an optimal value of the softening parameter. As already shown by Merritt, for too small a softening the estimates of the forces will be too noisy, while for too large a softening the force estimates are systematically misrepresented. In between there is an optimal softening, for which the forces in the configuration best approach the true forces. The value of this optimal softening depends both on the mass distribution and on the number of particles used to represent it. For a higher number of particles the optimal softening is smaller. More concentrated mass distributions necessitate smaller softening, but the softened forces are never as good an approximation of the true forces as for non-centrally concentrated configurations. We give good estimates of the optimal softening for homogeneous spheres, Plummer spheres and Dehnen spheres. We also give a rough estimate of this quantity for other mass distributions, based on the harmonic mean distance to the kth neighbour (k± 1,…,12), the mean being taken over all particles in the configuration. Comparing homogeneous Ferrers' ellipsoids of different shapes we show that the axial ratios do not influence the value of the optimal softening. Finally we compare two different types of softening, a spline softening and a generalization of the standard Plummer softening to higher values of the exponent. We find that the spline softening fares roughly as well as the higher powers of the power-law softening and both give a better representation of the forces than the standard Plummer softening.},

This chapter describes the first CUDA implementation of the classical Barnes Hut n-body algorithm that runs entirely on the GPU. The Barnes Hut force-calculation algorithm is widely used in n-body simulations such as modeling the motion of galaxies. It hierarchically decomposes the space around the bodies into successively smaller boxes, called cells, and computes summary information for the bodies contained in each cell, allowing the algorithm to quickly approximate the forces (e.g., gravitational, electric, or magnetic) that the n bodies induce upon each other. The Barnes Hut algorithm is challenging to implement efficiently in CUDA because it repeatedly builds and traverses an irregular tree-based data structure, it performs a lot of pointer-chasing memory operations, and it is typically expressed recursively. GPU-specific operations such as thread-voting functions are exploited to greatly improve performance and make use of fence instructions to implement lightweight synchronization without atomic operations. The main conclusion of the work is that GPUs can be used to accelerate irregular codes, not just regular codes. However, a great deal of programming effort is required to achieve good performance. The biggest performance win, though, came from turning some of the unique architectural features of GPUs, which are often regarded as performance hurdles for irregular codes, into assets. Future direction indicates workings on writing high-performing CUDA implementations for other irregular algorithms.}

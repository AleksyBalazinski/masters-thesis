\chapter{Time integration}
In the previous sections, we described various methods of calculating forces applied to particles in the simulation.
Once these forces are found, the evolution of the system in time can be tracked by integrating Newton's 2nd law of motion,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:newtons-second}
    \ddot{\mathbf{x}}_i = \frac{\mathbf{F}_i}{m_i}.
\end{equation}
In the following chapter, we briefly describe how these equations are used to advance the simulation in time and discuss key considerations when selecting an appropriate time integration scheme.

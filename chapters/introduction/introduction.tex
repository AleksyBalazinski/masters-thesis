\chapter{Introduction}
The dominant force over large distances is the gravitational force.
It controls the motion of planets in the solar system and is responsible for the evolution of stars and galaxies, and the whole cosmos \cite{nordtvedt2025gravity}.
Although the motion of two bodies orbiting each other lends itself to an analytical description, no general solution for systems comprising three or more bodies is known.
Therefore, the importance of numerical simulations of many-body systems (usually referred to as \textit{N-body simulations}) is hard to overestimate.

Even though the direct beneficiary of advances in the area of $N$-body simulations is the field of astrophysics, the development of such tools is highly interdisciplinary in nature.
The theory behind algorithms that make fast simulations of this type possible is often mathematically involved and requires a good grasp of general physics.
On the other hand, efficient implementation of these ideas demands proficiency in computer science, particularly in areas such as data structures, parallel computing, and performance optimization.
Consequently, the development of $N$-body simulation codes is challenging but also intellectually rewarding.

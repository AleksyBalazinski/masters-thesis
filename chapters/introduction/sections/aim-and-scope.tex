\section{Aim and scope}
This thesis has three main goals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop a program implementing the PM, \PThreeM{}, and Barnes-Hut algorithms focusing on correctness and performance;
    \item To introduce these algorithms and analyze their strengths and weaknesses through error analysis and performance benchmarks using our implementation;
    \item To implement simple astronomical system models to test and evaluate the methods.
\end{enumerate}
The field of $N$-body simulations has been extensively studied (see \autoref{sec:historical-development}), making novel contributions challenging.
However, since our implementation is written from scratch, we aim to provide practical insights via:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Comparing GPU and CPU implementations of the PM method;
    \item Parallelizing the short-range correction in the \PThreeM{} method;
    \item Implementing a cache-friendly tree construction for the Barnes-Hut algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

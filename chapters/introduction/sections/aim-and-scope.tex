\section{Aim and scope}
This thesis has three main goals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Developing a program implementing the PM, \PThreeM{}, and Barnes-Hut algorithms focusing on correctness and performance,
    \item Introducing these algorithms and analyze their strengths and weaknesses via error analysis and performance benchmarks using our implementation,
    \item Implementing simple astronomical system models to test and evaluate the methods.
\end{enumerate}
The field of $N$-body simulations has been extensively studied (see \autoref{sec:historical-development}), making novel contributions challenging.
However, since our implementation is written from scratch, we aim to provide practical insights via:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Comparing GPU and CPU implementations of the PM method,
    \item Parallelizing the short-range correction in the \PThreeM{} method,
    \item Implementing a cache-friendly tree construction for the Barnes-Hut algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

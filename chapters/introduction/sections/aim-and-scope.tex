\section{Aim and scope}
This thesis aims to achieve three main objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To develop a computer program implementing the PM, \PThreeM{}, and Barnes-Hut algorithms with an emphasis on correctness and performance,
    \item To provide an introduction to the algorithms above and describe their strengths and weaknesses through elementary error analysis and performance benchmarking using our implementation,
    \item To implement simple models of selected astronomical systems and to test and assess the implemented methods based on these models.
\end{enumerate}
The subject of $N$-body simulations has been extensively researched over many years, as is clear from \autoref{sec:historical-development}, and thus making a completely novel contribution to the field is challenging.
However, considering that our implementation is developed from scratch rather than based on any existing code, we hope to provide useful insights through the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Comparison of performance of the GPU and CPU implementations of the PM method,
    \item Parallelization of the short-range correction part of the \PThreeM{} algorithm,
    \item Implementation of a cache-friendly tree construction procedure in the context of the Barnes-Hut algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

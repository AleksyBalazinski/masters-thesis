\chapter{Particle-mesh method} % checked
The particle-mesh method can be described as the following sequence of four steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Assign masses to mesh points;
    \item Solve the field equation (\autoref{eq:poisson}) on the mesh;
    \item Calculate the field strength at mesh points;
    \item Find forces applied to individual particles by interpolation.
\end{enumerate}
In this section, each of these steps will be described in more detail.

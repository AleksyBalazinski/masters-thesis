\chapter{Results}
All implemented methods were applied to three scenarios:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Spiral galaxy simulation (\autoref{sec:galaxy-model}),
    \item Globular cluster simulation (\autoref{sec:globular-cluster-model}),
    \item Galaxy collision simulation (two galaxies modelled as ``disks with holes'', \autoref{subsec:disk-with-hole}).
\end{enumerate}
The choice of these scenarios well illustrates the versatility of the the methods introduced over the last couple of sections.

% \subsection{Performance analysis}
% The PM and \PThreeM{} methods were implemented exactly as described in the previous sections.
% The PM method was developed for both CPU and GPU architectures, using C++ and CUDA C++, respectively.
% The implementation relies on external libraries for fast Fourier transform computations: FFTW for the CPU version and cuFFT for the GPU version.
% A performance comparison of the PM method was conducted with $N$ ranging between 50,000 and 1,000,000 over 200 iterations (TSC mass assignment and two-point finite difference).
% The tests were run on a system equipped with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 GPU.
% For the purposes of performance evaluation, the parts of the code responsible for diagnostics collection (energy, momentum, etc.) were switched off.
% Since disk IO (saving simulation state) was the most time-consuming part of both the CPU and GPU implementation, only the final state of the simulation was saved in these tests.
% This means that data transfers from device to host were also not taken into account.
% The results of the test are displayed in \autoref{fig:cpu-vs-gpu-pm}.


% For the \PThreeM{} method, performance was measured using $N=50,000$ particles on a $128 \times 128 \times 64$ mesh with the TSC assignment scheme.
% The total runtime was approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds, with the time distribution among key algorithm components as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item HOC table initialization: 12\%
%     \item Short-range force calculations: 80\%
%     \item PM step: 7.5\%
% \end{itemize}
